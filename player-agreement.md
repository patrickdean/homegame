# Player agreement

## Buy In

The players will decide *how* or *why* their characters are invested in the world, adventure, or the party, not *if*. To that end, we'll use the first session to solidify the characters' backstories by creating the heroic chronicle, player bonds, and obligation.

## The Wangrod Defense

Character conflict can be good, but player conflict is always bad. Please be mindful of the other players wishes and make sure you aren't hampering their enjoyment of the game.

I don't wish to run a game that involves player vs player combat and please don't use "But this is what my character would do" as a defense if your action is inciting conflict.

## Role Play

Role playing will be encouraged, but the players may role play to the level that they feel comfortable with.

## Narrate failure

The players will narrate their skill check failures

## Loot Distribution

Loot distribution may be determined by the players. I recommend an even split with the players agreeing upon magic item distribution, but anything is fine as long as it doesn't cause player conflict.

## Player Absence

Ideally, all players will be present at all times, but it is understood that this can't always be the case. In case of absence, please do your best to give as much notice as possible.
