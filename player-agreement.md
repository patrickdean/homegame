# Player agreement

## Buy In

The players will decide *how* or *why* their characters are invested in the adventure or the parties, not *if*.

We'll use the first session to create the heroic chronicle, player bonds, and obligation. It is important that the characters have a reason to be together. The Players will "Buy-in"...ie, they choose *how* or *why* their character is interested in the adventure or staying with the group, not *if*.

## The Wangrod Defense

Character conflict can be good, but player conflict is always bad. Please be mindful of the other players wishes and make sure you aren't hampering their enjoyment of the game.

I don't wish to run a game that involves player vs player combat and please don't use "But this is what my character would do" as a defense if your action is inciting conflict.

## Narrate failure

The players will narrate their skill failures

## Role Play

Role playing will be encouraged, but rhe players may role play to the level that they feel comfortable with.

## Loot Distribution

Loot distribution may be determined by the players. I recommend an even split with the players agreeing upon magic item distribution, but anything is fine as long as it doesn't cause player conflict.
