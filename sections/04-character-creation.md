# Character Creation

## Level

Characters will begin play at level 2. If a new player joins the campaign, their character will be created no lower than the level of the lowest party member. When a player creates a replacement character, they will join the campaign with the same experience value as the character they replaced.

## Ability Score Generation

Players may use the point buy system (27 points) or the standard array of [15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8]. If a player uses obligation to give their character an Ability Score Increase or feat, the starting value of any given ability shall not exceed 17.

## Alignment

A relic from the past. Feel free to omit it or just use it as a compass, but don't use it as a justification for your character's bad behavior.

## Race

Variant human is **not** permitted because starting with a feat will be allowed via the Obligation system.

 Most other races will be permitted. Keep in mind that since this game will be more story driven that NPC attitudes towards various races will be taken into account. This could be good or bad depending on the experience you want to have as a player.

## Optional Rules

All feats will be allowed except Tavern Brawler. Multiclassing will be allowed, where it makes RP sense. Background customization is also allowed.

## Rough and Tumble

A pulp action story wouldn't be complete without without a tavern brawl and a tavern brawl isn't any fun if the only way for the characters to be effective in it is to paint the walls red with the blood of their enemies. To that end, all characters will begin play with a modified version of the tavern brawler feat(called 'Rough and Tumble' in D&D Beyond):

* You are proficient with improvised weapons.
* Your unarmed strike uses a d4 for damage.
* When you hit a creature with your unarmed strike or an improvised weapon on your turn, you can use a bonus action to attempt to grapple the target.
* You gain an additional 1 HP per level.

## Backstory

In this campaign, I hope to drive a lot of the story from the characters' backstories. Therefore, creating an interesting one is important. I caution against adding too much detail. A fully defined story may prove to be inflexible and make it difficult to work it into the campaign.


### Obligation

Obligation represents a major unresolved event in the character's backstory that will serve as one of their driving motivators. Players will be required to select (or roll for if they can't decide) an obligation. In this instance, feel free to add as much detail as possible as this part of your backstory isn't finished yet and will be a large factor in the campaign.

Obligation may give you the opportunity to have extra benefits at character creation as well. See section on Obligation.

#### Signature Skill

At character creature, the player will select their character's signature skill. This represents the skill that the character excels at above all others and should be tied to their backstory in some way. Players are recommended to make their character's signature skill unique from others in the party, but it is not required.

This may confer a benefit when the character's obligation is trigger. See Obligation for more details.

### Bonds

Bonds represent the relationships that the characters have with each other.

At creation, you will create at least one bond with another party member. At the end of each session, you may resolve one bond. Resolution depends on both you and the character you share the bond with. You suggest the bond is resolved, and, if they agree, it is. When you do, you will gain XP.

You will always have at least one bond and may often have many. New bonds are created whenever a bond is resolved.

See the section on Bonds for inspiration.

### Allies and Rivals

Players should integrate an ally and rival into their character's backstory. You may refer to to pages 194-195 of the Explorer's Guide to Wildemount and pages 123-125 of Xanathar's Guide to Everything for inspiration. Give them a relationship to your character as well as goals (XGtE 124). I'll handle defining their assets, plans, and their in game stats. Work them into your Obligation if you can, but it's not required.

### Heroic Chronicle

If you're having trouble coming up with a backstory, you can use the Heroic Chronicle on page 190 of the Explorer's Guide to Wildemount as inspiration.

For everyone else, at least take a look at it to help fill in a few blanks you have like home town, favorite food and ally/rival relationships. Also, be sure to read up on your homeland and town.

## Enjoyment is Paramount

If you're not enjoying a particular choice you've made with your character, I'm willing to be flexible and allow the ability to adjust your character one time. Additional respecs may be allowed at the DM's discretion.

If doesn't solve the problem, retirement is always an option.
