# Strain

Strain is a representation of how much psychological or mental damage a character has taken. As a mechanic, strain exists and a way for a PC to "push their luck" to accomplish great deeds. Strain damage may be taken in extreme conditions such as instances of mental trauma or environmental effects.

## Strain Threshold

A character's strain threshold is how much the can endure before they are stunned, dazed, or otherwise incapacitated. Their strain threshold is equal to their Wisdom score plus the number of Ability Score Increases/Feats their character has earned.

## Pushing Yourself

When strain is used to push a character beyond their normal limits

### Advantage

You may suffer 1 point of strain damage to roll an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage. This must be declared before the roll.

If a 20 is rolled on either die, it instead costs no strain.

### Disadvantage

You may suffer 1 point of strain damage to cause an enemy to roll an attack, ability check, or saving throw with disadvantage. This must be declared before the roll.

If a 1 is rolled on either die, it instead costs no strain.

### Change a failure into a success

You may suffer 3 points of strain damage to change a failed attack roll, ability check, or saving throw into a success.

### Critical Hit

You may suffer X?? 6? points of strain damage to change an attack roll into a critical hit.

### Exceeding your Strain Threshold

When you exceed your strain threshold, you temporarily gain a level of exhaustion until you are able to bring your strain back to below the threshold. If exceeding your threshold causes you to hit level 6 exhaustion, it's not temporary.

## Recovering Strain

There are several ways to recover strain

### Short Rest

Whenever a hit die is used to recover HP during a short rest, you may roll an additional hit die adding your Wisdom modifier instead of your Constitution modifier and recover that much strain (minimum 1). If no hit dice are spent, you may recover 1 strain. If you have exceeded your strain threshold, you may expend one hit die (with no hit point recovery) to set your strain equal to one less than your Strain Threshold.

### Long Rest

Resting comfortably recovers all strain. Resting uncomfortably recovers strain up to half of the strain threshold.

## notes/questions

* Strain would replace "strained ability check" for obligation ~ -1/-2/-4 threshold when obligation is triggered.
    * prevents characters from "pushing their luck" so much
* suffer strain to gain an additional action ? movement ? in combat?
* should strain just apply exhaustion permanently and allow it to interact with resting as normal ??
* should strain also be a representation of "luck" ? a la stress in blades in the dark???
* should strain be more short term like Edge of the Empire ? or more long term like Blades in the dark ?
    * Somewhere in the middle ?
* Should starting threshold be Wis Score ? or 10 + Wis Mod?
* How do characters improve their ability to endure strain?
    * by gaining xp: every 4 levels? when they gain ASI/Feat ?
        * ASI/Feat would allow an additional strain via obligation
* Offer a way to suffer strain to use strain to negate negative things as well, ie, downgrade an enemy's crit to a hit, or a hit to a miss and suffer disadvantage ?
