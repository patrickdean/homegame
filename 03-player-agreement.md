# Player agreement

## Buy In

The players will decide *how* or *why* their characters are invested in the world, adventure, party, or the scene, not *if*. To that end, we'll use the first session to solidify the characters' backstories, player bonds, and obligation.

We may begin a scene in medias res. After describing the scene, the DM may say, "Where are you and what are you doing?". It's the player's job to integrate the character into the scene.

## The Wangrod Defense

Character conflict can be good, but player conflict is always bad. Please be mindful of the other players wishes and make sure you aren't hampering their enjoyment of the game.

I don't wish to run a game that involves player vs player combat and please don't use "But this is what my character would do" as a defense if your action is inciting conflict.

## Role Play

Role playing will be encouraged, but the players may role play to the level that they feel comfortable with.

## Narrate failure

The players will narrate their skill check failures. When the player makes the roll, the DM describe the result and the player will get to describe how it happened. This should prevent situations where a character trips and falls, shattering a priceless Ming vase even thought said character has +14 Stealth.

## Loot Distribution

Loot distribution may be determined by the players. I recommend an even split with the players agreeing upon magic item distribution, but anything is fine as long as it doesn't cause player conflict.

## Discouraging Murderhoboism

The PCs aren't expected to be heroes, but neither should they be villains. Still, it might make sense for a character's story for them to become villainous. Such situations should be discussed with the DM as it is likely that a villainous character should be moved to the realms of NPC.

## Player Absence

Ideally, all players will be present at all times, but it is understood that this can't always be the case. In case of absence, please do your best to give as much notice as possible.
