        <h2 id="setting">Setting</h2>
        <p>The adventure will take place on the continent of Wildemount from Critical Role Season 2. You may familiarize yourself with the setting by reading the Explorer&#39;s Guide to Wildemount, but don&#39;t feel that you have to. We&#39;ll all learn it together through the game. If you do look through the book, please refrain from reading the included adventures. I will likely use one of them as inspiration for the initial adventure for this campaign.</p>

        <p>You&#39;ve never really found a place for yourself in the world yet. Be it by luck or by fate, you stumbled on a pamphlet of an explorer&#39;s guild.</p>
        <p>Intrigued by the promise the pamphlet you received from them, you decided to enlist in their cause.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <h5 id="the-bowen-company-pamphlet">The Bowen Company Pamphlet</h5>
            <p>Day to day life got you down? Looking for somewhere to run? Want to etch your name in to the annals of history? Look no further than the Bowen Company! Join this rip-roaring band of misfits as they seek to blaze new trails and make a name for themselves.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Visit exotic locales full of danger</li>
                <li>Carouse at run down taverns full of unsavory outlaws</li>
                <li>Solve perilous puzzles</li>

        <h2 id="flavor">Flavor</h2>
        <p>This campaign will attempt to evoke feelings of pulp adventure: exploring exotic locals, unique battles with big stakes, and running afoul of remarkable villains. All a perfect foil for our likewise exceptional heroes.</p>
        <p>Over the course of the campaign, characters will confront their own dark pasts as well as that of ancient civilizations and also be given the opportunity to strike out for themselves and form an adventuring company of their own.</p>
        <h2 id="open-ended">Open Ended</h2>
        <p>We will not be following a set adventure. I want to explore running a D&amp;D game where there is no set goal and see where the concept of shared story telling takes us and drop in interesting encounters and short adventures where needed.</p>
        <pre><code></code></pre>
        <h2 id="a-living-breathing-world">A Living, Breathing World</h2>
        <p>The characters aren&#39;t expected to be heroes, but shouldn&#39;t be villains, either.</p>
        <p>Actions have consequences, and while the characters may be big players in the world, they are not without rivals to their power. Characters will also have run-ins with the law, be sure to always to consider your choices and actions fully. An unjust murder may lead to a new obligation. Some settlements may allow you to make the problem go away with gold.</p>
        <h2 id="character-death-and-retirement">Character Death and Retirement</h2>
        <p>In the event of character death, a player may create a new character with the same experience value as the deceased character. Death should always be a possibility, but I don&#39;t intend to punish players for it happening.</p>
        <p>Characters may also be retired at logical intervals. New characters may be created following the same guidelines as death.</p>
        <h2 id="absent-characters">Absent Characters</h2>
        <p>Ideally, everyone will be available all the time, but I understand that isn&#39;t always the case. Given the nature of the game, there may be opportunities to run the game with fewer players present if the story allows it. In situations like this, I&#39;m willing to run the game with as few as two players.</p>
        <p>Absent characters will not earn experience. This may create an imbalance in party level and it&#39;s my belief that this will work perfectly fine in practice. If for whatever reason, this causes a player to fall behind considerably, we&#39;ll figure out how to address that should it. The goal is always to ensure the players are having fun.</p>
        <h2 id="allowed-source-materials">Allowed source materials</h2>
        <p>Any race, class, or character option from official Wizards of the Coast published materials will be allowed as long as it is not overly setting specific. If unsure of anything, run it by me.</p>
        <br />

        <p>In addition, the following content will also be allowed:</p>
        <h3 id="third-party">Third Party</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Gunslinger subclass for fighter (from Matt Mercer)</li>
            <li>Blood Hunter class (from Matt Mercer)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
        <p>I will be using a hybrid XP/milestone system. Experience will be awarded not based on monster participation, but rather by hitting various milestones. Milestones are assigned a rating (Minor, Medium, Major), and when overcome, players will be awarded XP based on that rating. XP values were generated approximate to the guidelines for Evaluating Encounter Difficulty on page 82 of the Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide. Consult the table to the right for specific experience point values by character level.</p>
        <p>Players should expect to earn XP every session. My hope is characters will advance in level every 2-3 sessions after level 4. I will strive to make adjustments to try and hit this goal.</p>
        <h3 id="bonus-experience">Bonus Experience</h3>
        <p>At the end of each session, bonus experience may be awarded depending on the answers to these three questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Did we learn something new and important about the world?</li>
            <li>Did we overcome a notable monster or enemy?</li>
            <li>Did we loot a memorable treasure?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For each &quot;yes&quot; answer, everyone gets experience equal to a minor milestone for their level.</p>
        <p>Players may also resolve bonds that they feel have been resolved. If the player whose character you have a bond with agrees, you may mark the bond as resolved. You gain minor XP and write a new bond with whomever you wish.</p>
        <h3 id="leveling-up">Leveling Up</h3>
        <p>When a character acheives enough experience to advance to the next level, they may do so during moments of relative safety. This may be after or in between missions, or during a long rest.</p>

    <div class="phb">
        <h1 id="dm-agreement">DM Agreement</h1>
        <p>The following are a list of some of the ideals that I, as the DM, strive to embody.</p>
        <h2 id="fan-of-the-heroes">Fan of the Heroes</h2>
        <p>A role playing game is a shared story telling experience between the DM and the players. The goal of any role playing game should then be the enjoyment of all involved, my goal is give each player a chance to shine.</p>
        <p>This doesn&#39;t mean I want to only see them succeed, either. I want to see them sweat and bleed and struggle and sometimes fail. I root for them because they face real challenges. They will be tried and may be found wanting. But that&#39;s when they&#39;re at their most interesting.</p>
        <h2 id="unintended-consequences">Unintended Consequences</h2>
        <p>The actions your characters undertake are risky. They have to be otherwise they wouldn&#39;t be adventurers. My goal is to help players understand the risk of the characters actions. If something would be obvious to the character, I will try my best to make sure it&#39;s obvious to the player. I find that it is profoundly unsportsmanlike to trick your players by withholding character information just because the player didn&#39;t think to ask for it.</p>
        <p>I&#39;ve played in far too many games where the DM describes a scenario that is not fully understood by the player and then commits the player to their course of action. I don&#39;t want to be the DM who says &quot;well, that&#39;s what you said you were going to do&quot; (ie, the DM&#39;s Wangrod defense) when the player didn&#39;t fully understand the situation. The players must have access to the information they need to make their decisions to help ensure they&#39;re having fun.</p>
        <h2 id="the-rule-of-cool">The Rule of Cool</h2>
        <p>It is my belief that 5th Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons is a very well designed game. I will generally follow the rules as written, except when their intent seems to be contradictory to practice. Occasionally, even their intent will deviate from what is actually fun and the rules may be bent in certain circumstances.</p>
        <p>As a fan of the heroes, and with goal of enabling players to take on the role of pulp action heroes, I will do my best to let the Rule of Cool have final say (within reason). Having said this, if there&#39;s an action that you&#39;d like to try that the rules might not traditionally support, let&#39;s talk about it. I want the actions that characters undertake to be audacious as I feel it increases the enjoyment of the game.</p>
        <pre><code></code></pre>
        <h2 id="make-failure-interesting">Make Failure Interesting</h2>
        <p>Ability checks in D&amp;D are binary and hearing &quot;it didn&#39;t work&quot; or &quot;you&#39;ve failed&quot; in response to a check is boring. I want any action the characters make to move the game forward. If a rogue fails a check with thieves&#39; tools, the lock may still be opened, just with additional consequences.</p>
        <h2 id="consequences-of-failure">Consequences of Failure</h2>
        <p>Since failure needs to be interesting, I will only ask for a roll if there is a consequence for failure. In situations where there is no consequence for failure, a character will just succeed at that task.</p>
        <h2 id="on-the-fly-rulings">On the Fly Rulings</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, an on the fly ruling will be required. If, upon retrospection, it is deemed that this ruling was incorrect, the ruling will be corrected for future sessions. If a retroactive ruling is possible given the circumstance, it will be applied.</p>
        <h2 id="transparency">Transparency</h2>
        <p>I find the game more interesting when players are aware of the challenge they are faced with. I intend to communicate the Armor and Difficulty classes of monsters and challenges. I will also roll monster attack and damage openly. Because of this, some rules that rely on an additional resource be spent(like a bardic inspiration die) before knowing success or failure will allowed to be rolled even though we will already know the result ahead of time.</p>
        <h2 id="continuous-improvement">Continuous Improvement</h2>
        <p>Pursuant to the goals above, please share feedback. I am human with flaws like everyone else. My goal is to run a fun game with fair and consistent rules. If you&#39;re not enjoying some aspect of the game, please talk to me about it and let&#39;s try and resolve it. Some of these rules may change or evolve as time goes on. The intent is to do so for the better.</p>
        <p>I&#39;m making this shit up as a go along. In a concerted effort to get better at making this shit up as I go along.</p>

    <div class="phb">
        <h1 id="player-agreement">Player agreement</h1>
        <h2 id="buy-in">Buy In</h2>
        <p>The players will decide <em>how</em> or <em>why</em> their characters are invested in the world, adventure, party, or the scene, not <em>if</em>. To that end, we&#39;ll use the first session to solidify the characters&#39; backstories, player bonds, and obligation.</p>
        <p>We may begin a scene in medias res. After describing the scene, the DM may say, &quot;Where are you and what are you doing?&quot;. It&#39;s the player&#39;s job to integrate the character into the scene.</p>
        <h2 id="the-wangrod-defense">The Wangrod Defense</h2>
        <p>Character conflict can be good, but player conflict is always bad. Please be mindful of the other players wishes and make sure you aren&#39;t hampering their enjoyment of the game.</p>
        <p>I don&#39;t wish to run a game that involves player vs player combat and please don&#39;t use &quot;But this is what my character would do&quot; as a defense if your action is inciting conflict.</p>
        <p>See: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoYR3eCFqoA">The Wangrod Defense</a></p>
        <h2 id="describe-actions-not-skill-checks">Describe Actions, Not Skill Checks</h2>
        <p>My preferred play style is one where the player describes the character&#39;s actions, not the skill they want to roll. The DM should ask for the roll. It practice, this plays out mostly the same but the key difference comes in when no roll is required. Players obviously like to roll dice, so if you want to look around an empty hallway and roll perception, if you roll high and the DM says there&#39;s nothing, it feels bad. Likewise if you roll low and the DM says there&#39;s nothing, you may still be suspicious. However, from the DM&#39;s perspective, no roll was required, nothing was there.</p>
        <p>While this is my preferred play style, I understand that these kinds of behaviors are ingrained in us and while I may desire to run the game perfectly, I may not always be successful. If you feel like I&#39;m forgetting about certain skills, it&#39;s still okay to ask if you can roll a particular skill.</p>
        <h2 id="role-play">Role Play</h2>
        <p>Role playing will be encouraged, but the players may role play to the level that they feel comfortable with.</p>
        <h2 id="narrate-failure">Narrate failure</h2>
        <p>The players will narrate their skill check failures. When the player makes the roll, the DM describe the result and the player will get to describe how it happened. This should prevent situations where a character trips and falls, shattering a priceless Ming vase even thought said character has +14 Stealth.</p>
        <h2 id="loot-distribution">Loot Distribution</h2>
        <p>Loot distribution may be determined by the players. I recommend an even split with the players agreeing upon magic item distribution, but anything is fine as long as it doesn&#39;t cause player conflict.</p>
        <h2 id="discouraging-murderhoboism">Discouraging Murderhoboism</h2>
        <p>The PCs aren&#39;t expected to be heroes, but neither should they be villains. Still, it might make sense for a character&#39;s story for them to become villainous. Such situations should be discussed with the DM as it is likely that a villainous character should be moved to the realms of NPC.</p>
        <pre><code></code></pre>
        <h2 id="player-absence">Player Absence</h2>
        <p>Ideally, all players will be present at all times, but it is understood that this can&#39;t always be the case. In case of absence, please do your best to give as much notice as possible.</p>

        <h2 id="level">Level</h2>
        <p>Players will begin play at level 2. If a new player joins the campaign, their character will be created no lower than the level of the lowest party member. When a player creates a replacement character, they will join the campaign with the same experience value as the character they replaced.</p>
        <h2 id="ability-score-generation">Ability Score Generation</h2>
        <p>Players may use the point buy system (27 points) or the standard array of [15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8]. If a player uses obligation to give their character an Ability Score Increase or feat, the starting value of any given ability shall not exceed 17.</p>
        <h2 id="alignment">Alignment</h2>
        <p>A relic from the past. Feel free to omit it or just use it as a compass, but don&#39;t use it as a justification for your character&#39;s bad behavior.</p>
        <h2 id="race">Race</h2>
        <p>Most races will be permitted. Keep in mind that since this game will be more story driven that NPC attitudes towards various races will be taken into account. This could be good or bad depending on the experience you want to have as a player.</p>
        <h2 id="optional-rules">Optional Rules</h2>
        <p>All feats will be allowed except Tavern Brawler. Multiclassing will be allowed, where it makes RP sense. Background customization is also allowed.</p>
        <h2 id="tavern-brawler">Tavern Brawler</h2>
        <p>A pulp action story wouldn&#39;t be complete without without a tavern brawl and a tavern brawl isn&#39;t any fun if the only way for the characters to be effective in it is to paint the walls red with the blood of their enemies. To that end, all characters will gain the following benefits from the tavern brawler feat:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You are proficient with improvised weapons.</li>
            <li>Your unarmed strike uses a d4 for damage.</li>
            <li>When you hit a creature with your unarmed strike or an improvised weapon on your turn, you can use a bonus action to attempt to grapple the target.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>
        <p>In this campaign, I hope to drive a lot of the story from the characters&#39; backstories. Therefore, creating an interesting one is important. I caution against adding too much detail. A fully defined story may prove to be inflexible and make it difficult to work it into the campaign.</p>
        <pre><code></code></pre>
        <h3 id="obligation">Obligation</h3>
        <p>Obligation represents a major unresolved event in the character&#39;s backstory that will serve as one of their driving motivators. Players will be required to select (or roll for if they can&#39;t decide) an obligation. In this instance, feel free to add as much detail as possible as this part of your backstory isn&#39;t finished yet and will be a large factor in the campaign.</p>
        <p>Obligation may give you the opportunity to have extra benefits at character creation as well. See section on Obligation.</p>
        <h4 id="signature-skill">Signature Skill</h4>
        <p>At character creature, the player will select their character&#39;s signature skill. This represents the skill that the character excels at above all others and should be tied to their backstory in some way. Players are recommended to make their character&#39;s signature skill unique from others in the party, but it is not required.</p>
        <p>This may confer a benefit when the character&#39;s obligation is trigger. See Obligation for more details.</p>
        <h3 id="bonds">Bonds</h3>
        <p>Bonds represent the relationships that the characters have with each other.</p>
        <p>At creation, you will create at least one bond with another party member. At the end of each session, you may resolve one bond. Resolution depends on both you and the character you share the bond with. You suggest the bond is resolved, and, if they agree, it is. When you do, you will gain XP.</p>
        <p>You will always have at least one bond and may often have many. New bonds are created whenever a bond is resolved.</p>
        <p>See the section on Bonds for inspiration.</p>
        <h3 id="allies-and-rivals">Allies and Rivals</h3>
        <p>Players should integrate an ally and rival into their character&#39;s backstory. You may refer to to pages 194-195 of the Explorer&#39;s Guide to Wildemount and pages 123-125 of Xanathar&#39;s Guide to Everything for inspiration. Give them a relationship to your character as well as goals (XGtE 124). I&#39;ll handle defining their assets, plans, and their in game stats. Work them into your Obligation if you can, but it&#39;s not required.</p>
        <h3 id="heroic-chronicle">Heroic Chronicle</h3>
        <p>If you&#39;re having trouble coming up with a backstory, you can use the Heroic Chronicle on page 190 of the Explorer&#39;s Guide to Wildemount as inspiration.</p>
        <p>For everyone else, at least take a look at it to help fill in a few blanks you have like home town, favorite food and ally/rival relationships. Also, be sure to read up on your homeland and town.</p>

        <h1 id="house-rules">House Rules</h1>
        <p>The following rules are presented as options to the players to spice up the gameplay--and the narrative. I don&#39;t intend to use many house rules, nor do I intend to break any intended mechanics currently in the game.</p>
        <h2 id="catch-your-breath">Catch your breath</h2>
        <p>At any time outside of an encounter (combat, social, or exploration), any player may use an action to catch their breath. Doing so will cause them to gain the benefits of a short rest. You may do this twice, regaining expended uses when you complete a long rest. Players may independently spend this resource as they see fit.</p>
        <p>This feature replaces the normal guidelines regarding taking a short rest.</p>
        <h2 id="success-at-a-cost">Success at a Cost</h2>
        <p>There is always the option to succeed. I offer success at a cost as an option if you come up short. Players that choose to succeed at a cost can negotiate with the Dungeon Master what they have to give up to succeed. Everything is on the table and the player is always able to walk away if the price is too high. But, sometimes, after an epic lead-up and a less-than-epic roll, adding a little negotiation to the control of the narrative can bring the story to a more satisfying conclusion.</p>
        <p>Gauge the cost of success versus what you might be willing to pay. Delivering a critical blow to a hated villain might be worth the cost of a beloved magical item breaking. Picking the lock to the dragon’s vault might be worth the cost of being haunted by the master thief who failed 200 years ago.</p>
        <h2 id="the-devils-bargain">The Devil&#39;s Bargain</h2>
        <p>Before a roll, any player or the DM can offer a devil&#39;s bargain, which is a negative effect which will happen regardless of the outcome of the roll, in exchange for advantage on the roll. The rolling player may accept or decline.</p>
        <p>So before the barbarian pushes the evil sorcerer off of the dias into the pit of snakes, the DM says: &quot;Devil&#39;s Bargain - you may take advantage on this test if you also knock the prisoner into the pit in your haste. Yes or No?&quot;</p>
        <h2 id="downtime">Downtime</h2>
        <p>Players will be awarded downtime, among other rewards for successfully completing milestones. Players will have options to spend downtime whenever not currently engaged in a mission.</p>
        <p>In addition to the normal downtime activities outlined in the PHB, XGtE, and DMG, players will be able to spend downtime in various other ways including retroactively in preparation for current missions/adventures. (See flashbacks when it is developed further).</p>
        <p>Players will accumulate their downtime days as a currency and are not required to spend them until they want to.</p>

        <h1 id="obligation">Obligation</h1>
        <p>Obligation plays a vital role in defining your Character. Simply put, obligation represents a debt a PC owes.

        <h2 id="types-of-obligation">Types of Obligation</h2>
        <p>The following list represents a good starting point for Obligation. This list is by no means exhaustive. If none of these Obligation types quite fits what you had in mind for your character&#39;s backstory, work with the DM to define the Obligation that&#39;s right for you.</p>
        <h3 id="addiction">Addiction</h3>
        <p>You have a strong addiction that you must keep feeding. It could be a physical addiction like drugs or alcohol, or it could be a mental addiction like gambling, stealing, or brawling.</p>
        <p>Avoiding this obligation could lead to withdrawal.</p>
        <h3 id="betrayal">Betrayal</h3>
        <p>This obligation can represent that the character is either the betrayer or the betrayed. The betrayal eats away at the character and affects their everyday life. The target of the betrayal may seek answers, compensation, or revenge.</p>
        <h3 id="blackmail">Blackmail</h3>
        <p>Someone has discovered one of your dirty secrets and is using that knowledge to blackmail you. In order to keep the secret safe, you must do what you&#39;re told. Your blackmailer is savvy enough to keep the demands simple enough to maintain the blackmail for as long as possible.</p>
        <pre><code></code></pre>
        <h3 id="bounty">Bounty</h3>
        <p>For some reason, you have a price on your head. This may be a legal warrant or even a contract by criminals, collection agencies, or even someone who felt their honor was violated in some way.</p>
        <h3 id="criminal">Criminal</h3>
        <p>You have a criminal record or were accused of a crime (perhaps even unjustly) and are embroiled in the legal system. From time to time, you may have to pay legal fees, make attempts to bury evidence, or make efforts to prove your innocence.</p>
        <h3 id="debt">Debt</h3>
        <p>You owe someone a great deal. That debt may consist of money or something else. To make matters worse, depending on who owns the debt, even paying it off fully might not get you fully off the hook. If you were able to get that money, you can surely get more...right?</p>
        <h3 id="dutybound">Dutybound</h3>
        <p>You have a deep sense of duty that you feel compelled to fulfill such as military service or making good on a contract, or following some kind of code. Unlike the Oath obligation, as Dutybound individual, you have some legal or ritualistic bind to an organization or cause making it extremely difficult or detrimental if you fail to live up to that commitment.</p>
        <h3 id="family">Family</h3>
        <p>You have deep ties to your family that require a great deal of time and attention. This could include providing care for or assistance to your siblings or parents, the management of an inheritance, trust, or family business, or simply mediating between squabbling family members.</p>
        <h3 id="favor">Favor</h3>
        <p>You owe a big favor. Perhaps officials looked the other way when you smuggled in goods, or a friend got you out of prison. Regardless, the favors are stacking up, and soon you&#39;re going to be asked to pay them back or return the favor. This favor could be called in a little at a time, prolonging the obligation.</p>
        <h3 id="oath">Oath</h3>
        <p>You have some sworn some sort of oath that dictates your thoughts and actions, shaping your moral view of the world. This could be an oath to a deity, a way of living, or a willingness to sacrifice for the betterment of some group or cause. Whatever the case, the Oath should be both serious and make life difficult for you in some ways. It is a personal and deep undertaking, possibly without a truly obtainable end goal in sight. If you do not live up to this oath, you face an internal and moral struggle.</p>

        <div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="phb">
        <h3 id="obsession">Obsession</h3>
        <p>You have an unhealthy obsession that tends to interfere in your life, whether with a celebrity, a region, a political movement, a cultural icon, or some other facet of society. You pursue this, possibly to the detriment of your health, finances, or well being. You tend to get along well with those who share your interest, but are looked upon with pity, amusement, or even a bit of fear by those who do not understand.</p>
        <h3 id="responsibility">Responsibility</h3>
        <p>You feel a strong sense of accountability or relationship to a person, place, or thing (a responsibility to kin would fall under the Family obligation). This could include a strong connection to a mentor, a strong desire to care for orphans in a given location, or taking on the needs of an under-represented minority.</p>
        <h2 id="obligation-inspiration">Obligation Inspiration</h2>
        <p>Obligation ties most strongly into background. Like backgrounds, Obligation is meant to develop the character&#39;s backstory and anchor them to the world by giving them established relationships and motivations. A character need not be limited by the options below as any character can have any Obligation if it fits their backstory.</p>

        <h2 id="signature-skill">Signature Skill</h2>
        <p>Players will select a signature skill for their characters upon character creation. This should be an actual skill and not Initiative or a Tools proficiency. This represents the skill that the character excels at above all others and should be tied to their backstory in some way. Players are recommended to make their character&#39;s signature unique from others in the party, but it is not required.</p>
        <h2 id="additional-obligation">Additional Obligation</h2>
        <p>Each player has the option to gain additional obligation in exchange for additional benefits. Players can only choose each option once and cannot gain more additional obligation than their original starting value.</p>

        <p>Obligation may have narrative or mechanical implications. Every session, the DM determines whether or not the group&#39;s total Obligation affects the game.</p>
        <h3 id="obligation-check">Obligation Check</h3>
        <p>Before each session, the DM rolls percentile dice and compares the results to the group&#39;s current outstanding Obligation. If the roll is greater than the party&#39;s total obligation, then their obligation is low enough that their collective debts are not pressing enough to affect them-- at least for now.</p>
        <p>If the roll is less than or equal to the total Obligation, then something related to their Obligation may introduce complications during the upcoming session. Furthermore, the roll can be used in conjunction with the group&#39;s Obligation table to determine exactly which PC&#39;s Obligation is triggered for the section.</p>
        <p>When the party&#39;s Obligation is triggered, they roll on the Strained Ability Check table and will suffer disadvantage on the check or checks that comes up for the duration of the session. All players will roll once on the table, but the player who&#39;s obligation is triggered will roll twice. If the same result occurs multiple times, no reroll is required as luck is on the character&#39;s side.</p>
        <p>If the DM triggered Obligation and the roll was doubles (ex &quot;11&quot; or &quot;44&quot;), the effects of triggering that Obligation is also doubled. The whole party will roll twice and the triggered player would roll four times.</p>
        <p>If the PC&#39;s signature skill is selected they receive advantage instead of disadvantage representing the rare instance of being able to overcome the odds and turn a disadvantage into an advantage.</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p>These mechanical effects represent either the internal or external pressure on the PC as a result of their Obligation. This could be as simple as the PCs being worried about paying down their Obligations and that concern distracting them and causing stress.</p>
        <p>However, triggering Obligation (especially if the DM rolls doubles) can also result in more tangible problems. Favors could be called in, or an addiction may bring with it a sudden craving that needs to be satisfied.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, even though the mechanical effects always come into play, it&#39;s up to the DM as to how this affects the characters narratively. The DM should never feel obligated to disrupt their own narrative or story in order to represent a triggered Obligation. The results can always be mental. For a PC with a &quot;bounty&quot; Obligation, the DM can always tell the player that the PC is suffering the penalties because they are worried that this adventure making it harder to avoid bounty hunters.</p>

        <h2 id="obligation-as-a-threshold">Obligation as a Threshold</h2>
        <p>Obligation can also be used as a threshold, measuring the group&#39;s infamy or social standing, depending on the volume and type of Obligation. Generally, as characters gain more Obligation, their ties deepen to the criminal underworld. Even if the Obligation itself seems innocuous, such as the Favor Obligation, the favors may be owed to someone with far more criminal links.</p>
        <p>The DM has the option to set thresholds for the group&#39;s (or individual&#39;s) total Obligation. In these cases, the DM may determine that the Obligation must be less than or greater than this threshold in order for them to attempt a certain task. A local politician may be unwilling to meet with a group whose Obligation exceeds 60, but a local crime lord may not trust a group whose Obligation is less than 50. In both cases, it&#39;s a matter of how the NPCs perceive the group&#39;s overall reputation.</p>
        <h2 id="obligation-as-a-resource">Obligation as a Resource</h2>
        <p>Sometimes characters have the option to voluntarily accept additional obligation to obtain items and accomplish goals that would normally be out of their reach. In these cases, the DM may increase an existing Obligation by a certain amount, or decide to create an entirely new Obligation to reflect the transaction or events.</p>
        <p>Not all Obligation is created equal. Obligation does not have an equivalent value in gold; it&#39;s value is solely dependent on the circumstances, what is being acquired, the person or people being negotiated with, and so on. Acquiring a certain magic item on the black market may require 5 Obligation from a well-known fence, but could require 15 Obligation from a politician who needs to pull a few strings to ensure he retains plausible deniability about the entire affair.</p>
        <h2 id="settling-obligation">Settling Obligation</h2>
        <p>Obligation is meant to be a constant source of drama in the campaign. Over time, characters may be able to settle their obligations. Some Obligations may go away entirely depending on their circumstances a debt may be paid, an oath fulfilled, or criminal charges may be dropped. In such cases, players should find ways to create new obligations for their characters so the Dungeon Master is always able to find ways to keep them engaged with the story.</p>
        <p>If in a particular instance, it doesn&#39;t make sense for a character&#39;s story to engage a new Obligation, the character may be retired or otherwise become an NPC.</p>

        <p>Bonds are a way to incentivize PC relationships. Bonds are what make you a party of adventurers, not just a random assortment of people. They’re the feelings, thoughts, and shared history that tie you together. You will always have at least one bond, and you’ll often have more.</p>
        <p>Each bond is a simple statement that relates your character to another player character.</p>
        <h2 id="resolving-bonds">Resolving Bonds</h2>
        <p>A bond is resolved when it no longer describes how you relate to that person. That may be because circumstances have changed—Thelian used to have your back but after he abandoned you to the goblins, you’re not so sure. Or it could be because that’s no longer a question—you guided Wesley before and he owed you, but he paid that debt when he saved your life with a well-timed spell.</p>
        <p>Any time you look at a bond and think “that’s not a big factor in how we relate anymore” the bond is at a good place to resolve. When you feel a bond is resolved, ask the player whose character that bond is with if they feel it is resolved. If they agree, the bond is resolved. Your character gains experience equal to a minor milestone for their level. See table for exact values.</p>
        <h2 id="writing-new-bonds">Writing New Bonds</h2>
        <p>You write a new bond whenever you resolve an old one. Your new bond may be with the same character, but it doesn’t have to be.</p>
        <p>When you write a new bond choose another character. Pick something relevant to the last session—maybe a place you traveled together or a treasure you discovered. Choose a thought or belief your character holds that ties the two together and an action, something you’re going to do about it. You’ll end up with something like this:</p>
        <div class='descriptive'>

            <ul>
                <li>Mouse’s quick thinking saved me from the white dragon we faced. I owe her a boon.</li>
                <li>Avon proved himself a coward in the dungeons of Xax’takar. He is a dangerous liability to the party and must be watched.</li>
                <li>Valeria’s kindness to the Gnomes of the Vale has swayed my heart, I will prove to her I am not the callous fiend she thinks I am.</li>
                <li>Xotoq won the Bone-and-Whispers Axe through trickery! It will be mine, I swear it.
        </div>

        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These new bonds are just like the old ones—use them, resolve them, replace them.</p>
