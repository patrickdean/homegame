# Success at a Cost

<br/>

### What are you willing to pay to succeed?

There is always the option to succeed. The game offers success at a cost as an option if the player comes up short. Players that choose to succeed at a cost can negotiate with the Game Master what they have to give up to succeed. Everything is on the table and the player is always able to walk away if the price is too high. But, sometimes, after an epic lead-up and a less-than-epic roll, adding a little negotiation to the control of the narrative can bring the story to a more satisfying conclusion.


Gauge the cost of success versus what the player might be willing to pay. Delivering a critical blow to a hated villain might be worth the cost of a beloved magical item breaking. Picking the lock to the dragon’s vault might be worth the cost of being haunted by the master thief who failed 200 years ago. Dungeon Masters will be surprised what sorts of trouble players will agree to in exchange for a sure thing. And if the teams can’t come to a deal, failure still stands as an interesting option.

### The Devil's Bargain
Before a roll, any player or the GM can offer a devil's bargain, which is a negative effect which will happen regardless of the outcome of the roll, in exchange for a bonus to the roll. The rolling player may accept of decline.
This could be used in 5e D&D easily by using advantage. So before the barbarian pushes the evil sorcerer off of the dias into the pit of snakes, the GM says: "Devil's Bargain - you may take advantage on this test if you also knock the prisoner into the pit in your haste. Yes or No?"
