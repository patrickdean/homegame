# Minotaur

The minotaurs of Xhorhas are strong in body, dedication, and courage. They are at home on the battlefield, willing to fight for their various causes. They combine a burning fury in battle with keen tactics that make them excellent commanders as well as valuable shock troops.

## Horns and Hooves
Minotaurs are barrel-chested humanoids with heads resembling those of bulls. Their horns range in size from about 1 foot long to great, curling weapons easily three times that length. They often ornament their horns with metal rings or sheathe them in metal to protect them from damage.

Manes of shaggy fur extend down minotaurs’ necks and powerful backs, and males have long tufts of hair on their chins and cheeks. Their legs end in heavy, cloven hooves. Minotaurs are born with long, tufted tails, but minotaurs of Asarius (and some others) have their tails docked as part of a coming-of-age ceremony; they find the heavy armor of the Aurora Watch much more comfortable without a long tail in the way.

## Strength and Zeal
Minotaurs are zealous and love battle. They are found among the Many Hosts of Ithagrad, but the minotaurs of Asarius, The City of Beasts are better known. Long associated with the Kryn Dynasty, they are well respected for their skill in battle. Many minotaurs also follow the Luxors as a way of rejecting the influence of Baphomet.

Minotaurs tend to vent their outrage through violence, but they aren’t generally quick to anger. They are passionate, loving their friends and partners fiercely, and they laugh loud and long at good jokes.
