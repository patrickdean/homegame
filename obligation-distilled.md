## Obligation Inspiration
Obligation ties most strongly into background. Like backgrounds, Obligation is meant to develop the character's backstory and anchor them to the world by giving them established relationships and motivations. A character need not be limited by the options below as any character can have any Obligation if it fits their backstory.

#### Obligations by Background

| Background             | Examples                                 |
|:----------------------:|:----------------------------------------:|
| Acolyte                | Oath, Responsibility                     |
| Charlatan              | Blackmail, Criminal, Debt                |
| Criminal               | Addiction, Bounty, Criminal, Debt, Favor |
| Spy                    | Betrayal, Dutybound, Favor               |
| Entertainer/Gladiator  | Debt, Favor, Obsession                   |
| Folk Hero              | Responsibility                           |
| Guild Artisan/Merchant | Debt, Favor                              |
| Hermit                 | Oath, Obsession, Responsibility          |
| Noble/Knight           | Blackmail, Dutybound, Favor, Family      |
| Outlander              | Bounty, Favor, Responsibility            |
| Sage                   | Dutybound, Obsession                     |
| Sailor/Pirate          | Addiction, Criminal, Debt                |
| Soldier                | Dutybound, Favor, Responsibility         |
| Urchin                 | Addiction, Debt, Favor                   |

### Obligations by Class
Certain classes may also be lean more towards certain obligations as well. For example, a paladin may be compelled by the Oath obligation. This by no means suggests that certain classes must take certain obligations. Perhaps the paladin does not feel as challenged by his Oath as he does by a favor he owes.

## Signature Skill

Players will select a signature skill for their characters upon character creation. This should be an actual skill and not Initiative or a Tools proficiency. This represents the skill that the character excels at above all others and should be tied to their backstory in some way. Players are recommended to make their character's signature unique from others in the party, but it is not required.

## Triggering Obligation

When the party's Obligation is triggered, they all roll once on the table below and suffer disadvantage on that ability check. The PC whose Obligation is triggered rolls twice. When the DM rolls doubles (ie, 11 or 44), the effects are doubled. The party rolls twice and the triggering PC rolls 4 times. Don't reroll for duplicates. If a PC rolls for their signature skill, they receive advantage instead of disadvantage.
