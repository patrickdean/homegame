# Character Creation

## Level

Players will begin play at level 2. If a new character enters play, they will be created no lower than the level of the lowest party member.

## Ability Score Generation

Players may use the point buy system (27 points) or the standard array of [15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8].

## Alignment

A relic from the past. Feel free to omit it or just use it as a compass, but don't use it as a justification for your character's bad behavior.

## Race

Most races will be permitted. Keep in mind that since this game will be more story driven that NPC attitudes towards various races will be taken into account. This could be good or bad depending on the experience you want to have as a player.

## Optional Rules

Feats will be allowed. Multiclassing will be allowed, where it makes RP sense. Background customization is also allowed.

## Backstory

### Heroic Chronicle

Players will build a backstory outline using the Heroic Chronicle system beginning on page 190 of the Explorer's Guide to Wildemount. Free to add detail, but I caution against adding too much. While a fully fleshed out backstory can certainly be interesting, it can also rob us of the ability to build it together. Leaving blanks makes it much easier for me to create compelling story hooks for your character.

### Obligation

I have ported the Obligation system from Star Wars: Edge of the Empire. Players will be required to select (or roll for) an obligation. Obligation may give you the opporunity to have extra benefits at character creation as well. See section on Obligation.

### Bonds

Players will be required to have at least one "Bond" with another party member. This won't have a mechanical benefit but instead will aid in giving characters a reason to be together

## Enjoyment is Paramount

If you're not enjoying a particular choice you've made with your character, I'm willing to be flexible and allow the opportunity to allow limited respec.

If a respec won't solve the problem, retirement is always an option.
