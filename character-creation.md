# Character Creation

## Level

Players will begin play at level 2. If a new player joins the campaign, they will be created no lower than the level of the lowest party member. When a player creates a replacement character, they will join the campaign with the same experience value as the character they replaced.

## Ability Score Generation

Players may use the point buy system (27 points) or the standard array of [15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8].

## Alignment

A relic from the past. Feel free to omit it or just use it as a compass, but don't use it as a justification for your character's bad behavior.

## Race

Most races will be permitted. Keep in mind that since this game will be more story driven that NPC attitudes towards various races will be taken into account. This could be good or bad depending on the experience you want to have as a player.

## Optional Rules

Feats will be allowed. Multiclassing will be allowed, where it makes RP sense. Background customization is also allowed.

## Tavern Brawler

A pulp action story wouldn't be complete without without a tavern brawl and a tavern brawl isn't any fun if all the only way for the characters to be effective in it is to paint the walls red with the blood of their enemies. To that end, all characters will gain the following benefits from the tavern brawler feat:

* You are proficient with improvised weapons.
* Your unarmed strike uses a d4 for damage.
* When you hit a creature with your unarmed strike or an improvised weapon on your turn, you can use a bonus action to attempt to grapple the target.

## Backstory

In this campaign, I hope to drive a lot of the story from the characters' backstories. Therefore, creating an interesting one is important. I caution against adding too much detail. A fully defined story may prove to be inflexible and make it difficult to work it into the campaign.

### Obligation

Obligation represents a major unresolved event in the character's backstory that will serve as one of their driving motivators. Players will be required to select (or roll for if they can't decide) an obligation. In this instance, feel free to add as much detail as possible as this part of your backstory isn't finished yet and will be a large factor in the campaign.

Obligation may give you the opporunity to have extra benefits at character creation as well. See section on Obligation.

### Bonds

Bonds represent the relationships that the characters have with each other.

At creation, you will create at least one bond with another party member. At the end of each session, you may resolve one bond. Resolution depends on both you and the character you share the bond with. You suggest the bond is resolved, and, if they agree, it is. When you do, you will gain XP.

You will always have at least one bond and may often have many. New bonds are created whenever a bond is resolved.

See the document on Bonds from Dungeon World for inspiration.

### Heroic Chronicle

If you're having trouble coming up with a backstory, you can use the Heroic Chronicle on page 190 of the Explorer's Guide to Wildemount as inspiration.

For everyone else, at least take a look at it to help fill in a few blanks you have like home town, favorite food and ally/rival relationships. Also, be sure to read up on your homeland and town.

## Enjoyment is Paramount

If you're not enjoying a particular choice you've made with your character, I'm willing to be flexible and allow the opportunity to allow limited respec.

If a respec won't solve the problem, retirement is always an option.
