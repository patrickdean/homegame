# Character Creation

## Level

Players will begin play at level 2. If a new player joins the campaign, they will be created no lower than the level of the lowest party member. When a player creates a replacement character, they will join the campaign with the same experience value as the character they replaced.

## Ability Score Generation

Players may use the point buy system (27 points) or the standard array of [15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8].

## Alignment

A relic from the past. Feel free to omit it or just use it as a compass, but don't use it as a justification for your character's bad behavior.

## Race

Most races will be permitted. Keep in mind that since this game will be more story driven that NPC attitudes towards various races will be taken into account. This could be good or bad depending on the experience you want to have as a player.

## Optional Rules

Feats will be allowed. Multiclassing will be allowed, where it makes RP sense. Background customization is also allowed.

## Backstory

### Heroic Chronicle

Players will build a backstory outline using the Heroic Chronicle system beginning on page 190 of the Explorer's Guide to Wildemount. Free to add detail, but I caution against adding too much. While a fully fleshed out backstory can certainly be interesting, it can also rob us of the ability to build it together. Leaving blanks makes it much easier for me to create compelling story hooks for your character.

### Obligation

I have ported the Obligation system from Star Wars: Edge of the Empire. Players will be required to select (or roll for) an obligation. Obligation may give you the opporunity to have extra benefits at character creation as well. See section on Obligation.

### Bonds

Players will be required to create at least one "Bond" with another party member. At the end of each session, you may resolve one bond. Resolution depends on both you and the character you share the bond with. You suggest the bond is resolved, and, if they agree, it is. When you do, you will gain XP equal to an Easy encounter for your character's level.

You will always have at least one bond and may often have many. New bonds are created whenever a bond is resolved.

See the document on Bonds from Dungeon World for inspiration.

## Enjoyment is Paramount

If you're not enjoying a particular choice you've made with your character, I'm willing to be flexible and allow the opportunity to allow limited respec.

If a respec won't solve the problem, retirement is always an option.
