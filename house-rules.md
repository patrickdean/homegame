# House Rules
The following rules are presented as options to the players to spice up the gameplay--and the narrative. I don't intend to use many house rules, nor do I intend to break any intended mechanics currently in the game.

## Catch your breath

At any time outside of an encounter (combat, social, or exploration), any player may use an action to catch their breath. Doing so will cause them to gain the benefits of a short rest. You may do this twice, regaining expended uses when you complete a long rest. Players may independently spend this resource as they see fit.

This feature replaces the normal guidelines regarding taking a short rest.

## Success at a Cost

There is always the option to succeed. I offer success at a cost as an option if you come up short. Players that choose to succeed at a cost can negotiate with the Dungeon Master what they have to give up to succeed. Everything is on the table and the player is always able to walk away if the price is too high. But, sometimes, after an epic lead-up and a less-than-epic roll, adding a little negotiation to the control of the narrative can bring the story to a more satisfying conclusion.

Gauge the cost of success versus what you might be willing to pay. Delivering a critical blow to a hated villain might be worth the cost of a beloved magical item breaking. Picking the lock to the dragon’s vault might be worth the cost of being haunted by the master thief who failed 200 years ago.

## The Devil's Bargain
Before a roll, any player or the DM can offer a devil's bargain, which is a negative effect which will happen regardless of the outcome of the roll, in exchange for advantage on the roll. The rolling player may accept or decline.

So before the barbarian pushes the evil sorcerer off of the dias into the pit of snakes, the DM says: "Devil's Bargain - you may take advantage on this test if you also knock the prisoner into the pit in your haste. Yes or No?"


## Downtime
Players will be awarded downtime, among other rewards for successfully completing milestones. Players will have options to spend downtime whenever not currently engaged in a mission.

In addtion to the normal downtime activities outlined in the PHB, XGtE, and DMG, players will be able to spend downtime in various other ways including retroactively in preparation for current missions/adventures. (See flashbacks).
