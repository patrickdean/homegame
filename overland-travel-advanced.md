# Overland Travel


## Movement

### Moving at a slow pace.

When moving at a slow pace, travel time is reduced and checks made for scouting and foraging are done with advantage.

### Moving at a normal pace.

Travel time is normal and all checks are made normally.

### Moving at a quick pace.

When moving at a quick pace, travel time is increased, all travel checks are made at a disadvantage and foraging is not possible.

### Difficult Terrain

Half movement

## Roles

During each day of overland travel, the party will appoint one member to each role. The roles may change from day to day, if desired.

Each day, everyone will make an ability check corresponding to their roll. On a success, they will gain roll twice for opportunities. On a partial success, they will roll once. On a failure, they will roll for a complication.

When making a roll for a danger or discovery, consult the corresponding table for the location.

##### Ideas for later

Locations should have major points of interest, perhaps undiscovered.

Tiered difficulties for making way inward.

Find ways to offer party advantages or bonuses for preparation

Locations have qualities like a malignant corrupting magical influence.

Some locations may be ~~almost~~ sentient.

Injuries as setbacks?

Could an injury be a strained ability check?

Prevent a player from preforming certain navigation duties for a time period?

Slow travel movement

Suffer hit dice strain for 1dX days  ?

Suffer exhaustion ?

The party loses faith in your ability to perform duty for 1dx days

How do these mechanics work with spells like good berry, cure wounds, etc.  ?

Encounter Dangers or Obstacles? Are these just the same concept?
Obstacles:
* natural features that present a challenge to the party
    * a raging river
        * ford
    * chasm or gorge
        * create a bridge?
    * etc
* obstacles should challenge the party's skills
    * perhaps athletics checks to cross a chasm, etc
    * some obstacles may limit the party's ability to continue in a certain direction
        * a solution should (almost) always be to find a way around (at the cost of time)
