# Flashbacks

Once in a while, there may come a time when the characters find themselves in a bind. Maybe a situation where they are missing a required tool needed for a job or when they could use the assistance of a contact or an ally, but the current situation makes it infeasible to do presently. In such a time, a player may spend downtime (and potentially gold) to arrange for the help or preparation they need retroactively.
