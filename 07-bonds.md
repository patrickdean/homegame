# Bonds

Bonds are a way to incentivize PC relationships. Bonds are what make you a party of adventurers, not just a random assortment of people. They’re the feelings, thoughts, and shared history that tie you together. You will always have at least one bond, and you’ll often have more.

Each bond is a simple statement that relates your character to another player character.

## Resolving Bonds

A bond is resolved when it no longer describes how you relate to that person. That may be because circumstances have changed—Thelian used to have your back but after he abandoned you to the goblins, you’re not so sure. Or it could be because that’s no longer a question—you guided Wesley before and he owed you, but he paid that debt when he saved your life with a well-timed spell.

Any time you look at a bond and think “that’s not a big factor in how we relate anymore” the bond is at a good place to resolve.

## Writing New Bonds

You write a new bond whenever you resolve an old one. Your new bond may be with the same character, but it doesn’t have to be.

When you write a new bond choose another character. Pick something relevant to the last session—maybe a place you traveled together or a treasure you discovered. Choose a thought or belief your character holds that ties the two together and an action, something you’re going to do about it. You’ll end up with something like this:

<div class='descriptive'>

* Mouse’s quick thinking saved me from the white dragon we faced. I owe her a boon.
* Avon proved himself a coward in the dungeons of Xax’takar. He is a dangerous liability to the party and must be watched.
* Valeria’s kindness to the Gnomes of the Vale has swayed my heart, I will prove to her I am not the callous fiend she thinks I am.
* Xotoq won the Bone-and-Whispers Axe through trickery! It will be mine, I swear it.
</div>

These new bonds are just like the old ones—use them, resolve them, replace them.
