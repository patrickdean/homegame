# Overland Travel

## Movement

The rules for movement remain largley the same as chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook.

## Resting

During overland travel, the rules for normal resting are altered. Short resting is done when the party makes camp for the night. The party may take a long rest by opting to make camp for 24 hours.

The reason for this change is to give the dangers of the wilderness the respect they deserve and to not trivialize the challenge presented by exploration.

## Roles

During each day of overland travel, the party will appoint one member to each role. The roles may change from day to day, if desired.

Each day, the characters will make an ability check corresponding to their role. On a failure, some complication may arise.

### Navigator

During overland travel, the Navigator plots the best course through dangerous or unfamiliar lands.

You may make a Wisdom (Survival) or Intelligence (Navigator's Tools) check.

### Scout

During overland travel, you take point and look for anything out of the ordinary.

Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.

### Quartermaster

During overland travel, you are responsible for safeguarding the party's food and provisions as well as preparing meals.

Make a wisdom check. If you are proficient in Cook's Utensils, you may add your proficiency bonus to the roll.

## Other Activities

Once the 3 main roles are fulfilled, additional party members may partake in the following activities.

### Foraging

While traveling at a normal or slow pace and not otherwise engaged in an other activity, a party member may forage for food.

Make a Wisdom (Survival) check vs the Forage DC of the location. On a success, you gain 1d4 rations.

```

## Making Camp

At the end of a day of traveling, the party settles into rest.

### Taking Watch

The party establishes a watch order and the GM will choose one person to roll 2d6. On a 10+, the night passes without event. On 7-9, something happens that's not necessarily dangerous. On 6 or lower, a danger approaches! Roll Wisdom (Perception). On a success, the party has time to prepare.

### End of Watch

Once the rest is completed, the party may spend hit dice as they normally would at the end of a short rest.

### Spending A Day Encamped

The party may choose to spend 24 hours encamped. When doing so, no movement is accomplished and the most activity the party can undertake during the day is foraging.

In the evening, the party will take watch as normal and resolve any danger that befalls them. At the end of watch, the party gains the benefit of a long rest.
