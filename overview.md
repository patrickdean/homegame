# Overview


## Setting

The adventure will take place on the continent of Wildemount from Critical Role Season 2. You may familiarize yourself with the setting by reading the Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, but don't feel that you have to. We'll all learn it together through the game. If you do look through the book, please refrain from reading the included adventures. I will likely use one of them as inspiration for the initial adventure for this campaign.

## Flavor

## Open Ended

We will not be following a set adventure. I want to explore running a D&D game where there is no set goal and see where the concept of shared story telling takes us and drop in interesting encounters and short adventures where needed.

## Experience

I will be using a hybrid XP/milestone system. Experience will not be awarded based on monster participation, but achieving milestones. Milestones will be assigned a difficulty, and when overcome, will be awarded XP based on that difficulty. XP values will be generated approximate to the guidelines for Evaluating Encounter Difficulty on page 82 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

Players should expect to earn XP every session. My hope is characters will advance in level every 2-3 sessions after level 4. I will strive to make adjustments to try and hit this goal.

## Character Death and Retirement

In the event of character death, a player may create a new character with the same (level|XP)? as the deceased character. Death should always be a possibilty, but I don't intend to punish players for it happening.

Characters may also be retired at logical intervals. New characters may be created following the same guidelines as death.

## Absent Characters

I am willing to run the game as long as there are at least 2 players present. Absent characters will not earn experience. This may create an imbalance in party level and it's my belief that this will work perfectly fine in practice. If a player falls behind considerably, we'll figure out how to address that should it come up. The goal is always to ensure the players are having fun.

## Allowed source materials

Options from the following sources will be allowed without restriction. If you want to use something that isn't listed in these sources, let me know. It's probably fine, I just haven't considered it.

### Core

* Player's Handbook
* Xanathar's Guide to Everything
* Explorer's Guide to Wildemount
* Tasha's Guide to Everything will likely be allowed when it has been made available

### Third Party

* Gunslinger subclass for fighter (from Matt Mercer)
* Blood Hunter class (from Matt Mercer)
