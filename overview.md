# Overview

## Setting

The adventure will take place on the continent of Wildemount from Critical Role Season 2. You may familiarize yourself with the setting by reading the Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, but don't feel that you have to. We'll all learn it together through the game. If you do look through the book, please refrain from reading the included adventures. I will likely use one of them as inspiration for the initial adventure for this campaign.

## Adventure Hook

You've never really found a place for yourself in the world yet. Be it by luck or by fate, you stumbled on a pamphlet of an explorer's guild.

Intrigued by the promise the pamphlet you received from them, you decided to enlist in their cause.

>##### The Bowen Company Pamphlet
> Day to day life got you down? Looking for somewhere to run? Want to etch your name in to the annals of history? Look no further than the Bowen Company! Join this rip-roaring band of misfits as they seek to blaze new trails and make a name for themselves.

## Flavor

This campaign will attempt to evoke feelings of pulp adventure: exploring exotic locals, unique battles with big stakes, and running afoul of remarkable villains. All a perfect foil for our likewise exceptional heroes.

Over the course of the campaign, characters will confront their own dark pasts as well as that of ancient civilizations and also be given the opportunity to strike out for themselves and form an adventuring company of their own.

## Open Ended

We will not be following a set adventure. I want to explore running a D&D game where there is no set goal and see where the concept of shared story telling takes us and drop in interesting encounters and short adventures where needed.

## A Living, Breathing World



## Experience

I will be using a hybrid XP/milestone system. Experience will not be awarded based on monster participation, but achieving milestones. Milestones will be assigned a difficulty, and when overcome, players will be awarded XP based on that difficulty. XP values will be generated approximate to the guidelines for Evaluating Encounter Difficulty on page 82 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

Players should expect to earn XP every session. My hope is characters will advance in level every 2-3 sessions after level 4. I will strive to make adjustments to try and hit this goal.

## Character Death and Retirement

In the event of character death, a player may create a new character with the same (level|XP)? as the deceased character. Death should always be a possibilty, but I don't intend to punish players for it happening.

Characters may also be retired at logical intervals. New characters may be created following the same guidelines as death.

## Absent Characters

Ideally, everyone will be available all the time, but I understand that isn't always the case. Given the nature of the game, there may be opportunities to run the game with fewer players present if the story allows it. In situations like this, I'm willing to run the game with as few as two players. Absent characters will not earn experience. This may create an imbalance in party level and it's my belief that this will work perfectly fine in practice. If for whatever reason, this causes a player to fall behind considerably, we'll figure out how to address that should it. The goal is always to ensure the players are having fun.
