# Pulp Campaign Overview

## Setting

The adventure will take place on the continent of Wildemount from Critical Role Season 2. You may familiarize yourself with the setting by reading the Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, but don't feel that you have to. We'll all learn it together through the game. If you do look through the book, please refrain from reading the included adventures. I will likely use one of them as inspiration for the initial adventure for this campaign.

## Adventure Hook

You've never really found a place for yourself in the world yet. Be it by luck or by fate, you stumbled on a pamphlet of an explorer's guild.

Intrigued by the promise the pamphlet you received from them, you decided to enlist in their cause.

>##### The Bowen Company Pamphlet
> Day to day life got you down? Looking for somewhere to run? Want to etch your name in to the annals of history? Look no further than the Bowen Company! Join this rip-roaring band of misfits as they seek to blaze new trails and make a name for themselves.
>
> * Visit exotic locales full of danger
> * Carouse at run down taverns full of unsavory outlaws
> * Solve perilous puzzles
> * Plunder ancient tombs of their untold riches
> * Battle ancient ferocious beasts
> * Outwit treacherous villains

## Flavor

This campaign will attempt to evoke feelings of pulp adventure: exploring exotic locals, unique battles with big stakes, and running afoul of remarkable villains. All a perfect foil for our likewise exceptional heroes.

Over the course of the campaign, characters will confront their own dark pasts as well as that of ancient civilizations and also be given the opportunity to strike out for themselves and form an adventuring company of their own.

## Open Ended

We will not be following a set adventure. I want to explore running a D&D game where there is no set goal and see where the concept of shared story telling takes us and drop in interesting encounters and short adventures where needed.

## A Living, Breathing World

The characters aren't expected to be heroes, but shouldn't be villains, either.

Actions have consequences, and while the characters may be big players in the world, they are not without rivals to their power. Characters will also have run-ins with the law, be sure to always to consider your choices and actions fully. An unjust murder may lead to a new obligation. Some settlements may allow you to make the problem go away with gold.


## Character Death and Retirement

In the event of character death, a player may create a new character with the same experience value as the deceased character. Death should always be a possibility, but I don't intend to punish players for it happening.

Characters may also be retired at logical intervals. New characters may be created following the same guidelines as death.

## Absent Characters

Ideally, everyone will be available all the time, but I understand that isn't always the case. Given the nature of the game, there may be opportunities to run the game with fewer players present if the story allows it. In situations like this, I'm willing to run the game with as few as two players.

Absent characters will not earn experience. This may create an imbalance in party level and it's my belief that this will work perfectly fine in practice. If for whatever reason, this causes a player to fall behind considerably, we'll figure out how to address that should it. The goal is always to ensure the players are having fun.

## Allowed source materials

Any race, class, or character option from official Wizards of the Coast published materials will be allowed as long as it is not overly setting specific. If unsure of anything, run it by me.

In addition, the following content will also be allowed:

### Third Party

* Gunslinger subclass for fighter (from Matt Mercer)
* Blood Hunter class (from Matt Mercer)

## Experience

I will be using a hybrid XP/milestone system. Experience will be awarded not based on monster participation, but rather by hitting various milestones. Milestones are assigned a rating (Minor, Medium, Major), and when overcome, players will be awarded XP based on that rating. XP values were generated approximate to the guidelines for Evaluating Encounter Difficulty on page 82 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. Consult the table to the right for specific experience point values by character level.

Players should expect to earn XP every session. My hope is characters will advance in level every 2-3 sessions after level 4. I will strive to make adjustments to try and hit this goal.

### Bonus Experience

At the end of each session, bonus experience may be awarded depending on the answers to these three questions:

* Did we learn something new and important about the world?
* Did we overcome a notable monster or enemy?
* Did we loot a memorable treasure?

For each "yes" answer, everyone gets experience equal to a minor milestone for their level.

Players may also resolve bonds that they feel have been resolved. If the player whose character you have a bond with agrees, you may mark the bond as resolved. You gain minor XP and write a new bond with whomever you wish.

### Leveling Up

When a character acheives enough experience to advance to the next level, they may do so during moments of relative safety. This may be after or in between missions, or during a long rest.
