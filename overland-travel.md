When moving at a slow pace, travel time is reduced and checks made for scouting and foraging are done with advantage.

### Moving at a normal pace.

Travel time is normal and all checks are made normally.

### Moving at a quick pace.

When moving at a quick pace, travel time is increased, all travel checks are made at a disadvantage and foraging is not possible.

## Roles

During each day of overland travel, the party will appoint one member to each role. The roles may change from day to day, if desired.

Each day, everyone will make an ability check corresponding to their roll. On a success, they will gain roll twice for opportunities. On a partial success, they will roll once. On a failure, they will roll for a complication.

When making a roll for a danger or discovery, consult the corresponding table for the location.
