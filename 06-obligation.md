# Obligation

Obligation plays a vital role in defining your Character. Simply put, obligation represents a debt a PC owes. At character creation, players may roll or choose an option based on their backstory from the table below. If starting out with two obligations, obligation values are split between the two options.

#### Obligation

| 57-64 | Family          |
| 65-72 | Favor           |
| 73-80 | Oath            |
| 81-88 | Obsession       |
| 89-96 | Responsibility  |
| 97-00 | Roll Twice      |

## Types of Obligation

The following list represents a good starting point for Obligation. This list is by no means exhaustive. If none of these Obligation types quite fits what you had in mind for your character's backstory, work with the DM to define the Obligation that's right for you.

### Addiction
You have a strong addiction that you must keep feeding. It could be a physical addiction like drugs or alcohol, or it could be a mental addiction like gambling, stealing, or brawling.

Avoiding this obligation could lead to withdrawal.

### Betrayal
This obligation can represent that the character is either the betrayer or the betrayed. The betrayal eats away at the character and affects their everyday life. The target of the betrayal may seek answers, compensation, or revenge.

### Blackmail
Someone has discovered one of your dirty secrets and is using that knowledge to blackmail you. In order to keep the secret safe, you must do what you're told. Your blackmailer is savvy enough to keep the demands simple enough to maintain the blackmail for as long as possible.

```
```

### Bounty
For some reason, you have a price on your head. This may be a legal warrant or even a contract by criminals, collection agencies, or even someone who felt their honor was violated in some way.

### Criminal
You have a criminal record or were accused of a crime (perhaps even unjustly) and are embroiled in the legal system. From time to time, you may have to pay legal fees, make attempts to bury evidence, or make efforts to prove your innocence.

### Debt
You owe someone a great deal. That debt may consist of money or something else. To make matters worse, depending on who owns the debt, even paying it off fully might not get you fully off the hook. If you were able to get that money, you can surely get more...right?

### Dutybound
You have a deep sense of duty that you feel compelled to fulfill such as military service or making good on a contract, or following some kind of code. Unlike the Oath obligation, as Dutybound individual, you have some legal or ritualistic bind to an organization or cause making it extremely difficult or detrimental if you fail to live up to that commitment.

### Family
You have deep ties to your family that require a great deal of time and attention. This could include providing care for or assistance to your siblings or parents, the management of an inheritance, trust, or family business, or simply mediating between squabbling family members.

### Favor
You owe a big favor. Perhaps officials looked the other way when you smuggled in goods, or a friend got you out of prison. Regardless, the favors are stacking up, and soon you're going to be asked to pay them back or return the favor. This favor could be called in a little at a time, prolonging the obligation.

### Oath
You have some sworn some sort of oath that dictates your thoughts and actions, shaping your moral view of the world. This could be an oath to a deity, a way of living, or a willingness to sacrifice for the betterment of some group or cause. Whatever the case, the Oath should be both serious and make life difficult for you in some ways. It is a personal and deep undertaking, possibly without a truly obtainable end goal in sight. If you do not live up to this oath, you face an internal and moral struggle.

\page

### Obsession
You have an unhealthy obsession that tends to interfere in your life, whether with a celebrity, a region, a political movement, a cultural icon, or some other facet of society. You pursue this, possibly to the detriment of your health, finances, or well being. You tend to get along well with those who share your interest, but are looked upon with pity, amusement, or even a bit of fear by those who do not understand.

### Responsibility
You feel a strong sense of accountability or relationship to a person, place, or thing (a responsibility to kin would fall under the Family obligation). This could include a strong connection to a mentor, a strong desire to care for orphans in a given location, or taking on the needs of an under-represented minority.

## Obligation Inspiration
Obligation ties most strongly into background. Like backgrounds, Obligation is meant to develop the character's backstory and anchor them to the world by giving them established relationships and motivations. A character need not be limited by the options below as any character can have any Obligation if it fits their backstory.

#### Obligations by Background

| Background             | Examples                                 |
|:----------------------:|:----------------------------------------:|
| Acolyte                | Oath, Responsibility                     |
| Charlatan              | Blackmail, Criminal, Debt                |
| Criminal               | Addiction, Bounty, Criminal, Debt, Favor |
| Spy                    | Betrayal, Dutybound, Favor               |
| Entertainer/Gladiator  | Debt, Favor, Obsession                   |
| Folk Hero              | Responsibility                           |
| Guild Artisan/Merchant | Debt, Favor                              |
| Hermit                 | Oath, Obsession, Responsibility          |
| Noble/Knight           | Blackmail, Dutybound, Favor, Family      |
| Outlander              | Bounty, Favor, Responsibility            |
| Sage                   | Dutybound, Obsession                     |
| Sailor/Pirate          | Addiction, Criminal, Debt                |
| Soldier                | Dutybound, Favor, Responsibility         |
| Urchin                 | Addiction, Debt, Favor                   |

### Obligations by Class
Certain classes may also be lean more towards certain obligations as well. For example, a paladin may be compelled by the Oath obligation. This by no means suggests that certain classes must take certain obligations. Perhaps the paladin does not feel as challenged by his Oath as he does by a favor he owes.

## Starting Obligation

The size of each player's starting Obligation is determined by the table below:

> ##### Starting Obligation
>
> | # of PCs | Recommended per PC  |
> |:--------:|:-------------------:|
> | 2        | 20                  |
> | 3        | 15                  |
> | 4        | 10                  |
> | 5        | 10                  |
> | 6+       | 5                   |

## Signature Skill

Players will select a signature skill for their characters upon character creation. This should be an actual skill and not Initiative or a Tools proficiency. This represents the skill that the character excels at above all others and should be tied to their backstory in some way. Players are recommended to make their character's signature unique from others in the party, but it is not required.

## Additional Obligation

Each player has the option to gain additional obligation in exchange for additional benefits. Players can only choose each option once and cannot gain more additional obligation than their original starting value.

Magic Items are subject to DM approval.

## Obligation in play

Obligation may have narrative or mechanical implications. Every session, the DM determines whether or not the group's total Obligation affects the game.

### Obligation Check

Before each session, the DM rolls percentile dice and compares the results to the group's current outstanding Obligation. If the roll is greater than the party's total obligation, then their obligation is low enough that their collective debts are not pressing enough to affect them-- at least for now.

If the roll is less than or equal to the total Obligation, then something related to their Obligation may introduce complications during the upcoming session. Furthermore, the roll can be used in conjunction with the group's Obligation table to determine exactly which PC's Obligation is triggered for the section.

When the party's Obligation is triggered, they roll on the Strained Ability Check table and will suffer disadvantage on the check or checks that comes up for the duration of the session. All players will roll once on the table, but the player who's obligation is triggered will roll twice. If the same result occurs multiple times, no reroll is required as luck is on the character's side.

If the DM triggered Obligation and the roll was doubles (ex "11" or "44"), the effects of triggering that Obligation is also doubled. The whole party will roll twice and the triggered player would roll four times.

If the PC's signature skill is selected they receive advantage instead of disadvantage representing the rare instance of being able to overcome the odds and turn a disadvantage into an advantage.

> | Value  | Type     | Character |

> | 16-25  | Family   | Wulgar    |
> | 26-35  | Duty     | Bruenor   |
> | 36-45  | Bounty   | Regis     |
>
> The DM arranges the group's obligation into a single table. This will allow the DM to see which character's obligation comes into play when they roll the percentile dice.

These mechanical effects represent either the internal or external pressure on the PC as a result of their Obligation. This could be as simple as the PCs being worried about paying down their Obligations and that concern distracting them and causing stress.

However, triggering Obligation (especially if the DM rolls doubles) can also result in more tangible problems. Favors could be called in, or an addiction may bring with it a sudden craving that needs to be satisfied.

Ultimately, even though the mechanical effects always come into play, it's up to the DM as to how this affects the characters narratively. The DM should never feel obligated to disrupt their own narrative or story in order to represent a triggered Obligation. The results can always be mental. For a PC with a "bounty" Obligation, the DM can always tell the player that the PC is suffering the penalties because they are worried that this adventure making it harder to avoid bounty hunters.

## Obligation as a Threshold

Obligation can also be used as a threshold, measuring the group's infamy or social standing, depending on the volume and type of Obligation. Generally, as characters gain more Obligation, their ties deepen to the criminal underworld. Even if the Obligation itself seems innocuous, such as the Favor Obligation, the favors may be owed to someone with far more criminal links.

The DM has the option to set thresholds for the group's (or individual's) total Obligation. In these cases, the DM may determine that the Obligation must be less than or greater than this threshold in order for them to attempt a certain task. A local politician may be unwilling to meet with a group whose Obligation exceeds 60, but a local crime lord may not trust a group whose Obligation is less than 50. In both cases, it's a matter of how the NPCs perceive the group's overall reputation.

## Obligation as a Resource

Sometimes characters have the option to voluntarily accept additional obligation to obtain items and accomplish goals that would normally be out of their reach. In these cases, the DM may increase an existing Obligation by a certain amount, or decide to create an entirely new Obligation to reflect the transaction or events.

Not all Obligation is created equal. Obligation does not have an equivalent value in gold; it's value is solely dependent on the circumstances, what is being acquired, the person or people being negotiated with, and so on. Acquiring a certain magic item on the black market may require 5 Obligation from a well-known fence, but could require 15 Obligation from a politician who needs to pull a few strings to ensure he retains plausible deniability about the entire affair.

## Settling Obligation
Obligation is meant to be a constant source of drama in the campaign. Over time, characters may be able to settle their obligations. Some Obligations may go away entirely depending on their circumstances a debt may be paid, an oath fulfilled, or criminal charges may be dropped. In such cases, players should find ways to create new obligations for their characters so the Dungeon Master is always able to find ways to keep them engaged with the story.

If in a particular instance, it doesn't make sense for a character's story to engage a new Obligation, the character may be retired or otherwise become an NPC.
