# The Game

## Overview

### Setting

The adventure will take place on the continent of Wildemount from Critical Role Season 2. You may familiarize yourself with the setting by reading the Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, but don't feel that you have to. We'll all learn it together through the game. If you do look through the book, please refrain from reading the included adventures. I will likely use one of them as an initial adventure for this campaign.

### Open Ended

We will not be following a set adventure. I want to explore running a D&D game where there is no set goal and see where the concept of shared story telling takes us and drop in interesting encounters and short adventures where needed.

## Character Creation

### Level

Players will begin play at level 2.

### Ability Score Generation

Players may use the point buy system (27 points) or the standard array of [15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8]

### Alignment

A relic from the past. You are free to use it as a compass, but don't use it as a justification for your character's bad behavior. Feel free to omit it as well.

### Character Death and Retirement

In the event of character death, a player may create a new character with the same (level|XP)? as the deceased character. Death should always be a possibilty, but I don't intend to punish players for it happening.

Characters may also be retired at logical intervals. New characters may be created following the same guidelines as death.

### Enjoyment is Paramount

If you're not enjoying a particular choice you've made with your character, I'm willing to be flexible and allow the opportunity to allow limited respec.

If a respec won't solve the problem, retirement is always an option.

### Heroic Chronicle

Players will build a backstory outline using the Heroic Chronicle system beginning on page 190 of the Explorer's Guide to Wildemount. Players are free to add detail, but I caution against adding too much. While a fully fleshed out backstory can certainly be interesting, it can also rob us of the ability to build it together. Leaving blanks makes it much easier for me to create compelling story hooks for your character.

### Obligation

I have ported the Obligation system from Star Wars: Edge of the Empire. Players will be required to select (or roll for) an obligation. See Obligation document

### Bonds

Players will be required to have at least one "Bond" with another party member. This won't have a mechanical benefit but instead will aid in giving characters a reason to be together

### Experience

I will be using a hybrid XP/milestone system. Experience will not be awarded based on monster participation, but achieving milestones. Milestones will be assigned a difficulty, and when overcome, will be awarded XP based on that difficulty. XP values will be generated approximate to the guidelines for Evaluating Encounter Difficulty on page 82 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

Players should expect to earn XP every session. My hope is characters will advance in level every 2-3 sessions after level 4. I will strive to make adjustments to try and hit this goal.

### Absent Characters

I am willing to run the game as long as there are at least 2 players present. Absent characters will not earn experience. This may create an imbalance in party level and it's my belief that this works perfectly fine in practice. If a player falls behind considerably, we'll figure out how to address that should it come up. The goal is always to ensure the players are having fun

## Allowed source materials

### Core

* Player's Handbook
* Xanathar's Guide to Everything
* Explorer's Guide to Wildemount
* Tasha's Guide to Everything will likely be allowed when it has been made available

### Third Party

* Gunslinger subclass for fighter (from Matt Mercer)
* Blood Hunter class (from Matt Mercer)

### Other

This list is not meant to be exhaustive. Other options will be considered at my discretion

## Optional Rules

Feats will be allowed. Multiclassing will be allowed, where it makes RP sense. Background customization is also allowed.

# DM Agreement

## Fan of the Heroes

A role playing game is a shared story telling experience between the DM and the players. The goal of any role playing game should then be the enjoyment of all involved, my goal is give each player a chance to shine.

## Unintended Consequences

My goal is to help players understand the risk of thier actions. I've played in far to many games where the DM describes a scenario that is not fully understood by the player and then commits the player to their course of action. I don't want to be the DM who says "well, that's what you said you were going to do" when the player didn't fully understand the situation. I will strive to give the players the information they need to make their decisions.

## The Rule of Cool

It is my belief that 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons is a very well designed game. I will generally follow the rules as written, except when their intent seems to be contradictory to practice. Occasionally, even their intent will deviate from what is actually fun and the rules may be bent in certain circumstances.

As a fan of the heroes, and with goal of enabling players to take on the role of larger than life heroes, I will strive to let the Rule of Cool have final say (within reason).

## Make Failure Interesting

Ability checks in D&D are binary and hearing "it didn't work" or "you've failed" in response to a check is boring. In my game, I will strive make sure that the game keeps moving forward and that failure does bring the game to a stand still.

## On the Fly Rulings

Sometimes, an on the fly ruling will be required. If, upon retrospection, it is deemed that this ruling was incorrect, the ruling will be corrected for future sessions. If a retroactive ruling is possible given the circumstance, it will be applied.

## Transparency

I find the game more interesting when players are aware of the challenge they are faced with. I intend to communcate the Armor and Difficulty classes of monsters and challenges. I will also roll monster attack and damage openly. Because of this, some rules that rely on an additional resource be spent(like a bardic inspiration die) before knowing success or failure will allowed to be rolled even though we will already know the result.

## Continuous Improvement

Pursuant to the goals above, please share feedback. If you're not enjoying some aspect of the game, please talk to me about it and let's try and resolve it. Some of these rules may change or evolve as time goes. The intent is to do so for the better.

# Player agreement

## The Wangrod Defense

Character conflict can be good, but player conflict is always bad. Please be mindful of the other players wishes and make sure you aren't hampering their enjoyment of the game.

I don't wish to run a game that involves player vs player combat and please don't use "But this is what my character would do" as a defense if your action is inciting conflict.

See: [The Wangrod Defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoYR3eCFqoA)

## Have a Reason to be Together

We'll use the first session to create the heroic chronicle, player bonds, and obligation. It is important that the characters have a reason to be together. The Players will "Buy-in"...ie, they choose *how* or *why* their character is interested in the adventure or staying with the group, not *if*.

## Narrate failure

The players will narrate their failure skill failures

## Role Play

Role playing will be encouraged, but rhe players may role play to the level that they feel comfortable with.

## Loot Distribution

Loot distribution can be determined by the players. I recommend an even split with the players agreeing upon magic item distribution, but anything is fine as long as it doesn't cause player conflict.

### Downtime
Players will be awarded downtime, among other rewards for successfully completing milestones. Players will have options to spend downtime at certain intervals.

In addtion to the normal downtime activities outlined in the PHB, XGtE, and DMG, players will be able to spend downtime in various other ways including retroactively for preparation for current missions/adventures. (See flashbacks).
