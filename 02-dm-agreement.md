# DM Agreement

The following are a list of some of the ideals that I, as the DM, strive to embody.

## Fan of the Heroes

A role playing game is a shared story telling experience between the DM and the players. The goal of any role playing game should then be the enjoyment of all involved, my goal is give each player a chance to shine.

This doesn't mean I want to only see them succeed, either. I want to see them sweat and bleed and struggle and sometimes fail. I root for them because they face real challenges. They will be tried and may be found wanting. But that's when they're at their most interesting.

## Unintended Consequences

The actions your characters undertake are risky. They have to be otherwise they wouldn't be adventurers. My goal is to help players understand the risk of the characters actions.

I've played in far to many games where the DM describes a scenario that is not fully understood by the player and then commits the player to their course of action. I don't want to be the DM who says "well, that's what you said you were going to do" when the player didn't fully understand the situation. I want the players to information they need to make their decisions to help ensure they're having fun.

## The Rule of Cool

It is my belief that 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons is a very well designed game. I will generally follow the rules as written, except when their intent seems to be contradictory to practice. Occasionally, even their intent will deviate from what is actually fun and the rules may be bent in certain circumstances.

As a fan of the heroes, and with goal of enabling players to take on the role of pulp action heroes, I will do my best to let the Rule of Cool have final say (within reason). Having said this, if there's an action that you'd like to try that the rules might not traditionally support, let's talk about it. I want the actions that characters undertake to be audacious as I feel it increases the enjoyment of the game.

## Make Failure Interesting

Ability checks in D&D are binary and hearing "it didn't work" or "you've failed" in response to a check is boring. I want any action the characters make to move the game forward. If a rogue fails a check with thieves' tools, the lock may still be opened, just with additional consequences.

## On the Fly Rulings

Sometimes, an on the fly ruling will be required. If, upon retrospection, it is deemed that this ruling was incorrect, the ruling will be corrected for future sessions. If a retroactive ruling is possible given the circumstance, it will be applied.

```

## Transparency

I find the game more interesting when players are aware of the challenge they are faced with. I intend to communicate the Armor and Difficulty classes of monsters and challenges. I will also roll monster attack and damage openly. Because of this, some rules that rely on an additional resource be spent(like a bardic inspiration die) before knowing success or failure will allowed to be rolled even though we will already know the result ahead of time.

## Continuous Improvement

Pursuant to the goals above, please share feedback. I am human with flaws like everyone else. My goal is to run a fun game with fair and consistent rules. If you're not enjoying some aspect of the game, please talk to me about it and let's try and resolve it. Some of these rules may change or evolve as time goes on. The intent is to do so for the better.

I'm making this shit up as a go along. In a concerted effort to get better at making this shit up as I go along.
